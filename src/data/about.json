  "body": "I’m Oliver, but you won’t find a full name here. Not because I’m trying to be mysterious, but because this blog isn’t about status or brand-building. It’s just me, sharing my thoughts on football.\n\nI was born in Munich, Germany. My mother is Spanish. My father is English. And I’ve lived long enough in all three cultures to know that football isn’t the same game depending on where you’re watching it. I speak English, Spanish, and German, and each language gives me a different lens to read the game through, whether it’s Marca hyping a LaLiga transfer, Bild dissecting Bundesliga tactics, or BBC reminding everyone of the magic of the Cup.\n\nI grew up in a home where football wasn’t really a thing. There weren’t family allegiances or old shirts hanging up. I didn’t inherit a club. No one handed me a scarf or said, “This is who we support.” It was the school playground that gave me football, not tradition.\n\nAnd that actually turned out to be a good thing.\n\nBecause without emotional chains or inherited rivalries, I learned to see football without bias. I learned it from the ground up, literally. On my own terms, through bruises, broken fingers, and every kid shouting “Pass!” but never doing it themselves.\n\nFootball didn’t come to me as a family ritual. It came as a blank page. And maybe that’s why now, all these years later, I’ve got so much to say.\n\nNow in my early twenties, living in Surrey, I finally have the space to write it.",

  "title": "🧤 The Playground Goalkeeper",
  "body": "I didn’t start out playing football because I loved it. I started because I had no choice.\n\nIn school, if you weren’t playing football during break time, you were basically invisible. I’d never played before, but every lunch break, there it was — a swarm of kids kicking a ball around, and nowhere else to go. So I joined in. And since I was new and had no clue what I was doing, I got thrown in goal.\n\nThat’s how it usually works, right? You don’t know how to dribble? Go in net.\n\nBut here’s the thing — I didn’t hate it. I actually loved it.\n\nI remember one day I broke my pinky finger saving a shot, and even with the cast still on, I was back in goal the next day. I didn’t want to stop. The joy of being in that moment, stopping goals, making saves, being part of the game, it hooked me. Not because anyone told me football was important, but because it made me feel something real.\n\nThen came Spain.\n\nVisiting my family there was always special, but my cousin took it to another level. He was ridiculously good, technical, driven, fast, and I looked at him the way you look at players on TV. I remember standing there thinking, “How does he do that?” And I wanted to learn.\n\nOne time, thanks to my uncle’s connections, we got to train at Real Zaragoza. We were five, six, maybe seven years old, just kids, but there we were, standing on the same pitch as the first team. This was around the time they won the Spanish Cup, I think. It felt massive. The stadium was enormous to me. I didn’t even know how rare that moment was back then. I just knew I wanted more of it.\n\nLooking back, those early days shaped a lot.\n\nNot because I was the best player, or even a good one. But because I played from instinct. There was no tactical understanding, no YouTube tutorials, no one telling me how to improve. Just raw joy, scraped knees, and playground rules.\n\nAnd that goalkeeper? He’s still part of me. Even now that I play on the wing, I’ve never forgotten what it means to throw yourself at the game, literally and figuratively, even if it means a broken finger.",

  "title": "🟡 Dortmund vs the World",
  "body": "Growing up in Munich, you learn pretty quickly that football is a religion. But there’s only one god — Bayern.\n\nEveryone — classmates, teachers, neighbours — supported Bayern Munich. You’d see red shirts everywhere, hear the same names over and over. And me? I just didn’t feel it. Not the club, not the dominance, not the smug certainty that Bayern were always going to win.\n\nSo I did what any stubborn kid might do. I went the other way.\n\nBorussia Dortmund had something different. The yellow kits. The working-class vibes. The underdog energy. And more importantly, they had Mats Hummels — calm, classy, smart. He wasn’t flashy, but he was solid. And as someone who was still playing as a defender, that mattered to me.\n\nSo I picked up my first kit, a Dortmund shirt, number 15, Hummels on the back, and I wore it proudly. In a city full of Bayern fans, that was basically blasphemy. But I liked being different. I didn’t know much about the Bundesliga yet. I didn’t know how good or bad Dortmund were. I just knew I didn’t want to be part of the crowd.\n\nAt the time, I didn’t realise how intense football identity could be in Germany. You pick the wrong shirt, and you get side-eyed for a month. But I was young, and I could get away with it. I was just the kid in PE rocking a Dortmund kit while everyone else wore red.\n\nIn hindsight, maybe that was one of the first football decisions I made entirely for myself. Not for attention. Not to impress anyone. Just because I liked how it felt. It wasn’t even about hating Bayern. It was about finding a space for myself in a game that didn’t feel made for me yet.\n\nThat yellow shirt wasn’t just merch. It was a choice to see the game differently.",

  "title": "🎮 From FIFA to Football Fan",
  "body": "Before I ever watched full 90-minute matches, I knew the names. Not from commentary or live games, but from FIFA.\n\nMy football education came through Career Mode. My first FIFA was 13, but really it all started on my iPod Touch. I remember sitting for hours, building squads, grinding training drills, and trying to max Fernando Torres out to 99 in every stat. I didn’t play online much. Ultimate Team didn’t hook me. What I loved was building something, watching players grow, and tinkering with formations. It was a private kind of football obsession.\n\nAnd Torres, well — he was my guy.\n\nHe was blonde like me, Spanish like my mum, and played for English clubs like my dad’s side followed. Every time I went to Spain, people would call me “Torres” just because I was blond. It started as a joke, something uncles or cousins would say, but I clung to it. I didn’t grow up with a national team to feel fully connected to, but Torres gave me something to hold onto. He became a symbol of both sides of who I was, and I felt proud of that. Watching him play made me feel like I belonged to something bigger, like there was space in football for someone like me.\n\nHe became my favourite player, not because of his stats, but because I could see myself in him. He wasn’t just someone I controlled in a video game. He was a bridge between cultures, between childhood and fandom. Torres was the first player who made football feel personal.\n\nSpain’s Euro and World Cup wins in 2008, 2010, and 2012 just reinforced that. I watched them lift trophies and thought, “This is mine too.”\n\nAt uni, things changed. I wasn’t playing football anymore, and I suddenly had time alone. No close friends around, no constant distractions. That’s when Career Mode came back into my life. Hard. I played with every Premier League team, every Championship team, and I rebuilt clubs from scratch. Somewhere in that process, something clicked.\n\nFIFA taught me tactics. It taught me player roles, formations, finances, and squad depth. I became obsessed with testing different systems, figuring out whether a 4-2-3-1 worked better for mid-table teams or how to survive relegation with a flat 4-4-2. I played Career Mode with every Premier League club and every Championship club, sometimes multiple seasons deep, just to see how different players developed.\n\nIt made me curious. I’d discover a player in FIFA and then look him up in real life. I’d build a team on the game and then want to see how they played on TV. In many ways, FIFA filled the gap left by not watching football as a kid. I wasn't raised on Match of the Day or Saturday broadcasts, but Career Mode gave me a way in, one that taught me how the game actually worked. That curiosity became habit, and habit became fandom.\n\nThat’s how I transitioned from player to fan. Not by growing up in a football-crazy home, but through a console, a few spreadsheets, and a strange fascination with team chemistry sliders.\n\nFIFA didn’t make me love football, but it opened the door.",

  "title": "⚡ Inazuma, Naruto, and Football Superpowers",
  "body": "Before I had access to Sky Sports or BT or even stable match streams, my football dreams didn’t come from pundits. They came from anime.\n\nEvery trip to Spain as a kid came with one secret highlight: Spanish TV. No Netflix. No Disney+. No Bundesliga packages. Just whatever channels my grandma had. And tucked between the cartoons and dubbed movies was a show that felt like it was made for me — Inazuma Eleven.\n\nI couldn’t get it in Germany. My dad had rigged our TV to get English channels, but Inazuma wasn’t part of that. So every time I went to Spain, I was glued to the screen. The colours. The characters. The drama. It was football, but bigger. More emotional. More magical. And when I got older and learned how to watch anime online, I binged the whole thing.\n\nThis show wasn’t just about football. It was about belief. About people who didn’t care about the game being pulled into it by someone who cared so much they couldn’t help but be moved.\n\nMark Evans, the main character, loved football like it was oxygen. And the way he convinced others to play, to try, to fight — I saw myself in that. I hadn’t played 11-a-side until I was older. I hadn’t grown up obsessed with watching football. But Inazuma made me believe that didn’t matter. That if I trained, if I trusted my teammates, if I loved the game for what it was, I could still be something.\n\nAnd then there was Naruto.\n\nI collected all 72 books. Every single volume. I read them over and over. The idea that effort, friendship, and a bit of stubbornness could overpower destiny — it stuck with me. And when I found Inazuma, it was like those same values were re-skinned in football boots. It all clicked.\n\nEven the DS games. I played them like they were life or death. Superpowered saves. Fire Tornadoes. Crazy combos. It wasn’t real football, but it stirred something in me. Something bigger than tactics or results. It made me believe that you didn’t need to have played from a young age to be good. You just needed to train, to trust your teammates, and to believe in what you were doing. That idea stuck with me. It made me feel like I still had time to grow into the game, even if I was starting later than most.\n\nIt told me I belonged, even if I started late.\n\nAnime didn’t just entertain me. It gave me permission. To be passionate. To train like I meant it. To believe that loving something deeply was enough of a reason to start.",

  "title": "🟣 Discovering Villa",
  "body": "For a while, football was something I played, not something I watched. I didn’t grow up tracking matchdays or club drama. I didn’t follow a team. I just knew I loved being on the pitch.\n\nBut then I went to university, and for the first time in years, I wasn’t playing at all.\n\nThat’s when YouTube became my stadium.\n\nI started watching Sky Sports clips, Premier League highlights, player compilations — just casually at first. But one video stuck with me. A match between Manchester United and Aston Villa. Jack Grealish picked up the ball on the left wing, dribbled in, and smashed it into the top corner. Not just the top corner — the kind of top corner you never forget. The kind of shot that lives in your head for years.\n\nThat goal changed everything for me.\n\nIt was electric. Confident. Raw. I didn’t know much about Grealish, or Villa, or United. But I knew I wanted to see more of that. I started following Grealish, then Villa. Watching more games. Reading match reports. Following results. And before long, it wasn’t about Grealish anymore.\n\nHe left. But I stayed.\n\nThat’s when I realised I wasn’t following a player. I was supporting a club.\n\nIt helped that Villa were growing. Every season felt like a step forward. I remember watching Dean Smith’s team and getting attached. I remember wondering why Jacob Ramsey kept getting picked, only to watch him blossom into one of my favourite players. I started learning how club football works, how confidence builds, how systems develop, how youth players aren’t just chosen on talent but on trust.\n\nAnd the weird thing? I had no connection to Birmingham. No family ties. No local pride. I lived nowhere near the club. But Villa still felt like mine.\n\nI think that’s part of what makes my fandom different.\n\nI came into football not through legacy, but through curiosity. Not through geography, but through instinct. I didn’t grow up reciting chants or memorising kits. I grew into the game from the outside, by watching, thinking, and feeling.\n\nI probably started watching properly around 18 or 19 years old. Before that, it was just me, a ball, and some playground glory. But once I found Villa, something changed.\n\nI wasn’t just watching football anymore. I was feeling it.",

  "title": "🏋️ The COVID Bootcamp",
  "body": "When I dropped out of uni and moved back to Germany, I wasn’t planning to go pro. I just wanted clarity. Space. A fresh start. But what I didn’t expect was that I’d fall into one of the most intense football phases of my life — and all during a global lockdown.\n\nCOVID shut everything down, but for me and my best friend at the time, it opened a door.\n\nWe decided, in the most chaotic and sincere way, to train like professionals. Not because we thought we had the talent — we were both average at best — but because we had time, we had passion, and we had each other. There was a park nearby. We had no excuses.\n\nSo we made a plan.  \nI bought us gear.  \nWe started running leap tests, doing passing drills, dribbling circuits, sprint intervals.  \nNo coaches. No expectations. Just effort.\n\nAnd something wild happened — I got good.\n\nI was already pretty athletic, but that stretch of time changed my whole game. I went from right back in high school to winger. I learned how to glide with the ball. How to move with purpose. How to attack defenders instead of just marking them. I wasn’t just playing anymore, I was expressing myself.\n\nWe trained almost every day. And on Sundays, we’d show up for amateur 11-a-side games. For the first time in my life, I understood what players went through physically. The fitness, the decision-making, the mental fatigue. Watching football after that became totally different. You see the game with new eyes when your lungs have burned the way theirs do.\n\nAnd no, I wasn’t scouted. No one came calling. But that wasn’t the point.\n\nThat bootcamp and that COVID bubble was for me. It was proof that love for the game doesn’t need a stage. Transformation doesn’t need a contract. You just need a ball, a friend who believes in it too, and enough stubbornness to show up when the world’s telling you to do nothing.\n\nThat chapter ended when life restarted. I moved again. The training slowed. But the confidence and joy I found in those months — that hasn’t gone anywhere.",

  "title": "🔄 Rediscovering Football in England",
  "body": "After all that momentum — the bootcamp, the 11-a-side games, the pure rhythm of football in Germany — life happened. I moved back to England.\n\nAnd everything just… slowed down.\n\nI didn’t play for a year. I was living with my parents again, this time by the coast in a small town. The vibe was completely different. Quiet. Beautiful. But not buzzing. No teammates. No training. No park around the corner where someone always had a ball. It felt like I had pressed pause on something that was just starting to get good.\n\nEven though I’m English on paper, at first I felt like a guest. I didn’t understand how to join a local club, how people talked about football, or what it meant to belong here. Germany made sense to me. It was simple — you found a team online, you showed up, and you played. In England, everything felt harder to access, like there was an invisible rulebook I hadn’t been given.\n\nThen came a job opportunity.\n\nI moved. Started fresh again. New place. New people. New version of me. And without knowing it, this job would give me exactly what I was missing: football.\n\nEvery Wednesday, they hosted a company kickabout. It wasn’t serious — just a weekly five-a-side session. But for me, it was everything. That one hour a week brought back the spark. It gave me teammates again. It reminded me what it felt like to create space, beat someone on the wing, shout for the pass. It made me feel like myself.\n\nAt the same time, something else was shifting.\n\nI started feeling more at ease living in England. I’d always been English on paper, sure, but culturally, I still felt a bit like a guest. Everything had been unfamiliar — how clubs worked, how casual conversations went, how people lived and watched football. Germany made sense to me. England took longer. But now, with football in my weekly routine, something clicked. I started to feel more grounded. More open to exploring.\n\nAnd that’s when I finally started going to games.\n\nBefore this, my only experience in stadiums was as a kid, training with Real Zaragoza in Spain, or visiting the Allianz Arena with a Liverpool-mad friend. I’d seen England vs. Germany. I’d seen 1860 Munich. But I hadn’t seen football live in England. Not properly. Not like this.\n\nAnd then suddenly, I was making it happen.\n\nThrough work, I got to be part of a charity event for girls’ football. I helped train a youth group alongside Rachel Daly, and the session took place at the Aston Villa training grounds. I saw Villa Park for the first time — even if just from the outside. And it hit me. This club that had lived in my head, on my screens, in my FIFA saves and post-match articles — now it was real. It was right there.\n\nI hadn’t even gone to a match yet. But I already felt like I’d arrived.",

  "body": "There’s something different about your first time at a stadium for your club.\n\nI’d seen stadiums before — big ones. I’d walked through the Allianz Arena in Munich. I’d watched England vs. Germany. I’d seen 1860 Munich. I’d even stood outside Villa Park during that charity day with Rachel Daly.\n\nBut I hadn’t been inside for a real match. I hadn’t heard the songs. I hadn’t felt the roar after a goal or seen my club on the pitch.\n\nThat changed when I owed a friend some money.\n\nWe’d gone on a trip to Slovenia together, me and an old friend from school. I still had a bit of debt to settle, and I said, “You know what? Let me buy you a Villa ticket. I’ll take you to a match.” He said yes. And suddenly, it was happening. My first ever Aston Villa game. At Villa Park. And I wouldn’t be going alone.\n\nIt was the 2024–25 season. Villa were flying high. John Durán was on fire. The buzz around the club was electric. I didn’t know what kind of game I’d get, but I just wanted to be there. That alone felt like enough.\n\nWe were 2–0 down by halftime.\n\nAnd I thought, okay, maybe this is what I get. A lesson in humility. Football doesn’t owe you the Hollywood script, even if you’ve waited years for your first game. But even so, at 2–0 down, I was still smiling. I was there.\n\nAnd then everything changed.\n\nOllie Watkins equalised. The crowd erupted. My heart did too. I can’t even remember the second goal clearly, it felt like it came instantly, as if the universe just blinked and we were level. And then Durán stepped onto the pitch.\n\nI was already obsessed with him. A young Colombian striker, raw and fast and fearless, and the Spanish connection made me root for him even more. I’d told my friend before the game: “Watch this guy. He’s going to be a star.”\n\nAnd then he scored the kind of goal that doesn’t just win games — it becomes part of your personal highlight reel forever. From distance. Pure power. Top corner. It reminded me of Marmoush’s Goal of the Season, but better. And the only reason it didn’t win was probably because Durán left for Saudi before the votes came in.\n\n3–2. Full-time. My first game. A comeback win. A wonder goal.\n\nI walked out of Villa Park that night with my voice gone, my heart full, and my bond to the club cemented. I’d followed Villa for a while by then, but this was the moment I felt it. This was when it stopped being fandom and started being something deeper.\n\nA memory. A connection. A place I belonged.",

  "body": "After my first Villa match, I felt unstoppable. Like I had unlocked a new level of football fandom — the live match level. And living near London meant I had access to even more. More games. More teams. More chances to witness football up close.\n\nSo when my Liverpool-supporting friend floated the idea of catching a match at Tottenham, I was in. Then a colleague mentioned wanting to see Liverpool vs. Manchester United. Suddenly, I had plans for two high-stakes, high-drama games. And somehow, both came through.\n\nThe first was Tottenham vs. United — a wild 4–3 banger in the Carabao Cup, with chaos from start to finish. The second, just days later, was Tottenham vs. Liverpool. Also madness. I think it ended something like 6–3. And across those two matches, I saw more than ten goals. It felt like football had just decided to show off for me.\n\nI had great seats. I got to see players I admired, like Son, who I’ve always loved watching even though there’s no Villa connection. It was pure football joy… until it wasn’t.\n\nSee, we didn’t buy away-end tickets. We didn’t really think about it. We just got what was available, and that landed us smack in the Tottenham home section. My Liverpool friend didn’t wear colours, thankfully. But he did start celebrating when Liverpool went 3–0 up.\n\nAnd that’s when it turned.\n\nPeople around us started murmuring. Then shouting. “He’s a Liverpool fan!” “Get him out!” One guy wouldn’t let it go. He kept turning around, raising his voice, pointing, threatening to call stewards. And all of this, with his 10-year-old son sitting next to him.\n\nWe stayed quiet, hoping it would blow over. But the guy got louder. Aggressive. The tension was real. People started looking. That weird, dangerous football energy you hope you’ll never feel — it was in the air.\n\nSo I snapped.\n\nI told him to chill. Asked what kind of example he was setting. Reminded him I was in a Tottenham shirt, which, thankfully, I had bought earlier that day just for the occasion, like a tourist. That shirt saved us. I leaned into it. “Come on, you Spurs,” I said. “What are you talking about? This guy’s just a friend.”\n\nIt worked. The guy backed down. Maybe it was the shirt. Maybe it was the confrontation. Either way, we stayed. But for a moment, it felt like we might not make it out unbothered.\n\nThat moment taught me something important.\n\nFootball is beautiful, but tribal. Passionate, but sometimes right on the edge. You can love the game, love the players, buy a shirt, pay for a seat — and still be seen as an outsider.\n\nAnd in that weird, terrifying, adrenaline-soaked moment, I realised something else too:\n\nThat Tottenham shirt I wore wasn’t just merch. It was armour.",

  "body": "By now, you’ve probably gathered — I didn’t grow up like most football fans.\n\nI wasn’t born into a club. I didn’t inherit chants, rivalries, or matchday rituals. I started late. I came from three cultures at once — Spain, England, and Germany — and somehow none of them handed me a team. But all of them gave me pieces of the game. And I built something from that.\n\nWhat makes Soccer Wrldwide different from other blogs, pundits, or fan channels is perspective.\n\nI can read football from three angles — the English take, the Spanish spin, and the German structure — and I see how the same match or the same moment gets interpreted completely differently depending on who’s telling the story. I’ve lived in three countries. I’ve played in three languages. And because I never belonged to a specific football culture, I’ve had the freedom to question all of them.\n\nI haven’t written a match breakdown yet. But I’ve read enough to know when I disagree. Sometimes I watch a pundit and think, “That’s completely off.” Other times, I nod along. What I want isn’t to shout the loudest or be “right.” I just want to be in the conversation.\n\nSo if you’re reading this blog for the first time, here’s what I’d say:  \nLet me know what you think. Even if you disagree. Especially if you disagree.\n\nI want to write this blog the same way I play football — with joy, curiosity, and a bit of unpredictability. Maybe one day I’ll build a football anime-style game or app. That’s the dream. I’m just starting my coding journey now, so I know it’s far off. But it’s in the pipeline. Somewhere between pixels and passion, I’ll get there.\n\nI try to write with logic, but emotion finds its way in too. Some posts will be tactical. Others will just be raw. And that’s okay. Football is both — cold analysis and burning passion.\n\nAnd honestly? Any kind of comment makes me happy.  \nPraise. Feedback. Banter. Even if you’re just taking the piss, go for it.\n\nLife’s short. Football’s fun.  \nIf you're laughing at something I wrote, or challenging it, or even just skimming it while you’re bored at work — that means I’m doing something right.\n\nWelcome to Soccer Wrldwide.
